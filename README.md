# Code for Computational Physics (fall of 2019)

## Build instructions

To build and run all assignment code with default data a simple `make` should suffice. (Alternatively
one can run `make assignment`).


## Build prerequisites

This project uses Go. To build the go source, multiple open source compilers are available. See
[the Go website](https://golang.org) for more information on how to obtain a compiler for your
operating system and architecture.


## Contained folders

- `problems` ----- answers to problem sheets
- `assignment` --- answers to assignment problems
- `pkg` ---------- reusable packages
