# Code for Computational Physics at Imperial (fall of 2019)

## Build instructions

To build and run all assignment code with default data a simple `make` should suffice. (Alternatively
one can run `make assignment`). To generate the submitted reports run `make pdf` and to generate
the submitted ZIP archive run `make zip`.

(Note that the `zip` make target will create a zip with all files in the current directory, to generate
a tidy and small file, use `make clean zip`)


## Build prerequisites

This project uses Go. To build the go source, multiple open source compilers are available. See
[the Go website](https://golang.org) for more information on how to obtain a compiler for your
operating system and architecture.

### Installation example macOS

If you are using homebrew on macOs, the installation should be as simple as:
```bash
brew install golang
```

### Installation example Ubuntu

If you are using Ubuntu, you might want to install Go using snap:
```bash
sudo snap install --classic go
```

### Notes on removing the Go installation

Any files generated by Go when building this project will either be located in this folder, or in
`$HOME/go` (unless you manually changed your `GOPATH`, run `go help gopath` for more information).

To remove everything, deinstall Go using your package manager, then delete `$HOME/go`.
